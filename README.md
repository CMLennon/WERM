# WERM -- Weighted Empirical Risk Minimization (WERM) based Causal Effect Estimation

A set of codes for Weighted Empirical Risk Minimization (WERM) based causal effect estimation, described in [**Learning Causal Effects via Weighted Empirical Risk Minimization**](https://causalai.net/r62.pdf). WERM estimator is supporting to estimate the mean of the causal effect estimation (i.e., E[Y|do(x)]).
